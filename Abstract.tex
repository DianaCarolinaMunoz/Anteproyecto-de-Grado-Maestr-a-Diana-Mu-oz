The exponential increase in the use of telemedicine systems has generated important initiatives for the implementation of new support products that complement the follow-up activities for patients who require it. The management of information technologies in the health sector makes it possible to reinforce the services that are currently in command due to the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this project is to develop an assistive product that can be integrated into a spirometry device and that can be managed remotely by a patient who has been prescribed respiratory treatment. The use of innovative methodologies and techniques is proposed for the determination of requirements and the development of software that will be explained throughout the document.
